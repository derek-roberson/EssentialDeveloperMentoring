## User session management

#### Currently we are using a singleton name MyAccount, that we access throughout the project to get access to variables. I would like to find an approach that:

* Handles storage of a token in keychain
* Allows us to access user account variables in each file, without relying on singleton and shared state
* Handles session expiration

## Text Message Chat

#### As a user, I need a screen that shows me my text history with a lead and gives me the ability to respond so that I donâ€™t miss communications and respond in a timely manner.

* When a user taps on the text button at the top of the lead details screen or on the cell phone number and chooses text, go to this screen. 
* Name of lead will appear at the top
* Back button in top left will take you back to the lead details screen
* Compose text box will be at the bottom of the screen and keyboard will pop up when the box is tapped.
* A send button will need to be enabled when something has been typed
* There will be a mute AI button if an AI conversation is going on. 
* Unmute AI will appear if there was an AI conversation, but that conversation has been muted. 
* When a message is sent from this screen, reload messages with the last message displayed in the next text bubble if we get a success from the text message API.

___
* Load messages starting from the bottom
* Reload next set of messages when you reach top of screen
* Most recent message should display at the bottom of the screen
* Message is shown on right side of screen (sender side) when the mdid in the fromMember object (message.messageDetail[0].fromMember.mdid) is equal to the account object mdid (MyAccount.shared.mdid)
